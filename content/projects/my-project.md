## About the project

You can find the current release on [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/allegheny-computer-science-203-s2021/Team5Project2)!

 - This was a final project for CS203, and was quite a challenging one. It was my first time implementing graphics into a Python program. This was done using PySimpleGUI which was a challenge in it self to learn, however well worth it. Over all the project was fun to complete, and gave the user a nice looking way to play tic-tac-toe against friends or an AI.
