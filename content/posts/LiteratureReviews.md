 - In two or three sentences, discuss the goals of this article.

 The article is trying to review different assessment items used by health app frameworks. It is directed towards individual or organizational users and is trying to analyze the evaluation methods used in the apps frameworks.


 - What is /are the general task(s) that all the methods address in the article?

 All methods were backward searched using terms such as "health apps", "evaluation" and "framework". The article covers papers from 2011 to 2020 and also included studies that were about scaling and scoring to the apps frameworks as well.


 - What are some of the leading methods introduced and discussed in this paper?

 Some of the leading methods and materials were "search strategy and selection criteria" as well as "data extraction and analysis".


 - What is the context of the discussion of these methods? For instance, are there demonstrations in light of some task that they address?

 The context of the data extraction and analysis method was to use different reviewers to screen the title and abstract of all the articles, and then have a third reviewer screen both groups. If there were any disagreement between screenings other authors would join in to reach a consensus.



 - How can some of these methods be used in your own work? What purpose would the method serve in your work?

 These methods could help me preform a review of my own, on a different topic other then healthcare apps, as they were pretty broad methods.

 - What is the goal of this article?

 The article performs a systematic mapping study about major software engineering trends in different courses.

 - In about 100 words, please summarize the main goal of the article.

 Adding on, they look into how Agile software development is one of the major trends of the study. The article takes into account 126 papers centered around software engineering trends, practices and teaching approaches. They saw that 79.4% of software engineering education studies were associated with Agile software development. The article also found that most trends were centered around project based learning, which goes hand and hand with Agile framework. As well finding out that software engineering education is adapting to industrial movements.

 - What is the goal of this article?

 The goal of the article is to demonstrate that software developers must have a security mindset across their engineering practices.

 - In about 100 words, please summarize the main goal of the article.

 These developers must put emphasis on security during the requirements gathering phase, that way it will be included in the development phase of the software. Another focus of the paper is to describe potential approaches for the requirements gathering team and the technical team. The article also brings in AI and machine learning as a tool for the requirements gathering team. They also gather experts in the field on there theories for while requirements gathering teams fail to focus of the security aspects of the software.


### Two relevant software tools

##### QGrid
- https://github.com/Q-Mobile/QGrid

QGrid is a a small add on to swiftUI that adds a collection view into SwiftUI, for creating easy to use grids in applications.

##### SwiftUICharts
- https://github.com/AppPear/ChartView
This extension is useful adding very visually pleasing and easy to use charts to display information to the user.
