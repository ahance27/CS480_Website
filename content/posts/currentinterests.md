My current research interest is app development with Xcode, Swift & SwiftUI. SwiftUI is Swifts graphical counter part, and is responsible for the graphics behind an iOS or MacOS app. It caught my attention as I like the idea of being able to create solutions for issues or inconveniences in mine, and others day to day life with their smartphones and computers. I also love how Xcode incorporates an emulator to preview each line of code as you right it in real time. To me this is super interesting and helpful when working with SwiftUI code, as errors can be seen right away, and even mistakes that still compile but aren't what was intended can be spotted instantly. I also find the syntax it self to be really intuitive and easy to learn. Apple's own ~15 hour tutorial on SwiftUI is really well done as well and has been a helpful tool in my learning process, and keeps me on a pace I like.
