#### Questions
1. Hardware: What hardware equipment is necessary to run this project? Include computer specifications or access to a cloud service.

A computer running macOS.

2. Tools: What software, libraries, and similar do you need to complete your project? Provide at least three examples of resources (software tools, programming languages, libraries, etc.) you will use to complete your project.

Xcode, being the primary and most necessary software for developing swiftUI. Swift is the language needed for creating apps with Xcode and Swift. And swiftUI is the library used by Swift to incorporate graphics into the apps.

3. Skills: How do the skills that you possess contribute to the completion of your proposed project? Discuss your knowledge of programming languages you might use, familiarity with libraries, ability to install software, your proven record of learning new technical skills, etc.

I have been learning swiftUI, through apples tutorials and have been doing with developing that skill set. That being the only language needed for my project is a good thing, as it will make it more feasible.

4. Data: Does your project require the use of existing data? If so, what data will you need, where will you obtain this data, how much can you obtain, how much is sufficient to use in your proposed project? If you plan to generate data, discuss how you will do so, where you will store the data, and how you will ensure its security.

I don't believe that my project will require too much existing data, however working with API's is a form of working with user data, and that will need to be done securely and ethically.

5. Time: How long do you anticipate for this project to take? How long will each part of the project take to complete? Remember that you will only have 2-3 months for the implementation of your project.

Working with APIs, UIs, swift backend code and graphics would probably take a solid 2 months. Probably a few weeks for API work, and a few weeks for swiftUI development.

6. Results: What do successful results look like? How will you test your project for both correctness and efficiency?

Making sure the app runs on different devices, and check for bugs and make sure all buttons, features and looks work as projected.

7. Analysis: How will you analyze the results? What approach will you use in the analysis? What experiments will you run to demonstrate your project and obtain results for analysis?

The results with be functioning code, that does what it is intended to do. Having a secure and ethical iMessage app that connects perhaps multiple streaming services together for people to share music with each other regardless of there paid for service.

8. Other abilities and resources: What else do you need for this project? Is there anything else that you may need to use or implement at some point to make this project successful? What is your back-up plan if your original project process fails?

API's and knowledge on how to work with them to grab information from apps such as spotify and apple music would be nice.

9. Threats to Validity: What might invalidate your reported results? For example, are there any assumptions you made in your experimental design, is the data set you plan to use large enough, are you relying on someone else's work that may contain mistakes, is your research process reproducible?

I don't believe their are any threats to validity.
