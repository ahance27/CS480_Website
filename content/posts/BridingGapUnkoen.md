#### Questions

1. Summarize the knowledge gap that emerges from your chosen research area.

There is a knowledge gap that arises in the intersection of user privacy and software development. My chosen area being specifically SwiftUI and broader software development, reflects this gap significantly.

2. How do you know that a gap exists? How does relevant literature motivate or provide justification to the completion of the gap? Identify at least four research articles or other materials which identify the gap. Please include four references in this discussion. Note: it is entirely likely that new references may need to be discovered for this discussion.

 The gap most definitely exists because there is lots of article to show how important it is for engineers to work on better app security and privacy. An article I used in assignment 2 was actually creating a guide for app developers and software engineers to follow that allowed them to implement good privacy and security practices in there work.

3. State and introduce at least one research question that, when answered, will fill the knowledge gap.

 How can app developers and software engineers effectively implement user oriented privacy within their software?

4. Broadly, describe the steps that you will take to answer the research question(s), and fill the knowledge gap.

 There could be many different routes to improve the way software engineers create their software. All of the documented articles above mention different ways to improve this in different regards and for different applications. However the underlying fact is that most of the time, developers are lazy, and don't go the extra mile to ensure that their users will have a secure, and good experience using their software. I think that some steps to answer the research question could be; identifying where apps most commonly lack user privacy, payment and age verification process there are not necessary to app utility and even just user data security in general and its security against hackers.
